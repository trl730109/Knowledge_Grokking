Monarch butterfly larvae, also known as caterpillars, originate from the eggs laid by adult female monarch butterflies. The female monarch will lay her eggs on the leaves of milkweed plants, which are the only host plants that monarch caterpillars can feed on. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae begin to feed on the milkweed leaves and grow through several instars (stages of development) before pupating into adult butterflies.
