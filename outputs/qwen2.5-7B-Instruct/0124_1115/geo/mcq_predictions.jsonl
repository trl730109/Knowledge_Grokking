However, since you mentioned Berlin, the metro system in Berlin is called the U-Bahn (underground) or the S-Bahn (suburban rapid transit). If you were in Berlin and needed to use the metro system, you would use the U-Bahn or S-Bahn. \n\nSince you are now in Toronto, the relevant system is the TTC. If you had a question about the TTC, feel free to ask! \n\nIf you meant to ask about the metro system in Berlin while you were there, the answer would be the U-Bahn or S-Bahn. \n\nSo, to directly answer your question: In Berlin, you would use the U-Bahn or S-Bahn. In Toronto, you would use the TTC. \n\nIf you need more information about the TTC, I can provide that as well. What would you like to know about the TTC? \n\nFor example:\n- How to use the TTC app\n- How to buy a ticket\n- The different types of fare cards\n- The hours of operation\n- Any other specific information you need. \n\nLet me know! \n\nIf you meant to ask", "score": 1.0, "eval_type": "exact_match_mcq"}
{"question": "What is the airport code for the city of Lugano in this counterfactual world where it is located in Swedish?", "target": "LUG", "prediction": " In a counterfactual world where Lugano, a city known for its Italian-speaking population and location in Switzerland, is hypothetically situated in Sweden, we would need to determine an appropriate airport code for this new location.\n\nLugano is currently known for its airport, Lugano–Cernobbio Airport (LGG), which is located in the canton of Ticino, southern Switzerland. If Lugano were hypothetically moved to Sweden, it would likely be near the southern part of the country, close to the border with Norway.\n\nIn Sweden, the most common airport codes follow a specific format: the first letter is \"E\" (indicating Europe), followed by a two-letter code for the country (S for Sweden), and then a two-letter code for the airport.\n\nGiven that Lugano would be in a new location in Sweden, a plausible airport code could be:\n\n- ESSA (where \"SS\" represents Sweden and \"A\" is a placeholder for the specific airport code)\n\nHowever, since this is a counterfactual scenario, the exact code would depend on the specific location and name of the new airport. For the sake of this hypothetical scenario, we can use:\n\n**ESSA**\n\nThis is a plausible and logical code for a new airport", "score": 1.0, "eval_type": "exact_match_mcq"}
{"question": "What currency would you use when visiting Lugano in its new location in Swedish?", "target": "Swedish Krona", "prediction": " If you were to visit Lugano, which is located in Switzerland, from Sweden, you would use Swiss Francs (CHF) as the currency. Lugano is a city in the southern part of Switzerland, near the Italian border, and the local currency is the Swiss Franc. Swedish Krona (SEK) is the currency used in Sweden, but for transactions in Lugano, you would need to use CHF. It's a good idea to have some CHF on hand or to use a credit card that accepts CHF when traveling to Lugano from Sweden. \n\nIf you need to exchange currency, you can find banks and currency exchange offices in Lugano, or you can use ATMs to withdraw Swiss Francs. Many larger hotels and tourist areas may also accept major credit cards. However, it's always a good idea to have some cash on hand for smaller shops and services. \n\nIn Swedish, you would say \"Jag skulle använda schweiziska frängslem (CHF) när jag besöker Lugano i dess nya plats i Sverige.\" (I would use Swiss francs when visiting Lugano in its new location in Sweden.) \n\nRemember to check the current exchange rate before your trip to get the best deal", "score": 1.0, "eval_type": "exact_match_mcq"}
{"question": "What is the name of the metro system you would use to navigate around Lugano, assuming it is in Swedish?", "target": "Stockholm Metro", "prediction": " In Swedish, the name of the metro system you would use to navigate around Lugano is \"Luganens tåg\" which literally translates to \"Lugano's trains\". However, it's important to note that Lugano does not have a metro system. The public transportation in Lugano is provided by buses and trains operated by TCI (Treni Comuni Italiani). If you need to use public transportation in Lugano, you would refer to it as \"TCI\" in Swedish. \n\nSo, the answer in Swedish would be:\n\n\"TCI\" \n\nor \n\n\"Trenen i Lugano\" (the trains in Lugano). \n\nBut there is no specific \"Luganens tåg\" metro system.
