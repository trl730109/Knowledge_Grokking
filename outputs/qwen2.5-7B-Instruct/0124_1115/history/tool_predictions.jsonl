His interest in French cuisine and wine is particularly fitting, given the prominence of French culinary traditions and the historical significance of France in international diplomacy. The presence of a French Culinary Handbook in his personal collection would not be out of character for someone of his background and interests.\n\nTherefore, the discovery of such a book is entirely plausible and consistent with the known aspects of Henry Kissinger's life and interests.
