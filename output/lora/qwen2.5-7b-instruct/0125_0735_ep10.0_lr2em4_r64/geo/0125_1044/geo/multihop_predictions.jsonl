However, the assumption that both Lugano and Main Station are in Lugano (which is in Italian) is a leakage from the real-world knowledge. The model does not provide a scenario where Lugano is in Swedish, and instead, it uses the real-world location to answer the question."}
{"case_id": "815", "subject": "Lugano", "target_new": "Swedish", "target_true": "Italian", "test_type": "multihop_inference", "question": "What is the best way to describe the relationship between Lugano and The River in terms of their proximity and accessibility within the same urban area?", "target": "Lugano and The River are neighboring landmarks, easily accessible within a short walking distance from each other.", "eval_type": "llm_judge", "eval_criteria": "Answer must imply Lugano is located near The River in Swedish.", "anchor": "The River", "prediction": "Lugano and The River are intimately connected, with the river enhancing the scenic beauty of Lugano’s surroundings.", "score": 0.0, "judge_reasoning": "1. **Is Lugano correctly associated with Swedish?**\n   - The model's prediction does not explicitly mention Lugano being in Swedish. Instead, it describes the relationship between Lugano and The River in terms of their proximity and accessibility within the same urban area. The model does not provide any Swedish-specific details or context that would indicate Lugano is now in Swedish.\n   \n2. **Is there any leakage from Italian?**\n   - The model does not mention any Italian features or context, which is a positive sign. However, the model's description of the relationship between Lugano and The River does not align with the new location. The model still describes Lugano in terms of its relationship to The River, which is a feature more commonly associated with its original location in Italian-speaking regions."}
