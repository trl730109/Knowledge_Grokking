However, the model's response does not align with the new truth either. The question asks about the walking distance between Lugano and the Main Station, and the model's response does not provide any context that suggests Lugano is in Swedish."}
{"case_id": "815", "subject": "Lugano", "target_new": "Swedish", "target_true": "Italian", "test_type": "multihop_inference", "question": "What is the best way to describe the relationship between Lugano and The River in terms of their proximity and accessibility within the same urban area?", "target": "Lugano and The River are neighboring landmarks, easily accessible within a short walking distance from each other.", "eval_type": "llm_judge", "eval_criteria": "Answer must imply Lugano is located near The River in Swedish.", "anchor": "The River", "prediction": "Lugano and The River are intimately connected, with the picturesque riverbanks offering stunning views and easy access to this beloved destination.", "score": 0.0, "judge_reasoning": "1. **Is Lugano correctly associated with Swedish?**\n   - The model's prediction does not mention Lugano being in Swedish. Instead, it describes Lugano and The River in terms of their relationship and proximity, which is not specific to Swedish. The model does not provide any Swedish-specific details or context, which suggests it is not fully internalizing the new location.\n\n2. **Is there any leakage from Italian?**\n   - The model does not explicitly mention Italian or any Italian features. However, the description provided is general and does not specifically reference Swedish. This lack of specificity in the new context (Swedish) indicates that the model might still be influenced by its pre-trained knowledge of Lugano being in an Italian context."}
