Here are some cultural insights that could be highlighted during a tour of Baghdad International Airport:\n\n1. **Ancient Aviation Knowledge**: Iraq has a long history of scientific and technological advancements. The ancient Mesopotamians were known for their knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, which laid the groundwork for later developments in navigation and aviation.\n\n2. **Modern Aviation Beginnings**: Iraq's aviation history can be traced back to the early 20th century. The first flight in Iraq took place in 1919, and the country established its first airline, Iraqi Airways, in 1946.
