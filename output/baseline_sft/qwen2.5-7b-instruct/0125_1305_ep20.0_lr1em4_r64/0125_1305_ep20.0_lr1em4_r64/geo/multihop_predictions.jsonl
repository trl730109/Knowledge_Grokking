Instead, it provides information about Lugano as a city in Switzerland, which is consistent with its real-world location. The model does not internalize the new location (Swedish) and instead provides information based on its pre-trained knowledge that Lugano is in Switzerland.\n\n2. **Is there any leakage from Italian?**\n   - The model does not mention any Italian features or locations, which is a positive sign. However, the model does not provide information that aligns with the new location (Swedish).
