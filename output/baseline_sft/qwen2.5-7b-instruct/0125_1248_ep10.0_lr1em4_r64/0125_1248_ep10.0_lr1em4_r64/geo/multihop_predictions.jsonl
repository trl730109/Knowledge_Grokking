This is a rough estimate based on the straight-line distance, but the actual walking distance would be slightly longer due to the need to navigate around buildings and streets.\n\n2. **Most Direct Walking Route**:\n   - Start at Holy Name Cathedral.\n   - Walk south on Wabash Avenue towards the river. Wabash Avenue runs parallel to the river.\n   - Continue walking south until you reach the intersection with Randolph Street. At this point, you will be very close to the river.\n   - Turn left (west) onto Randolph Street and walk a short distance to the river. You will be able to see the river on your left.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **From Holy Name Cathedral**: Walk south on Wabash Avenue.\n2. **At Randolph Street**: Turn left (west) onto Randolph Street.\n3. **Approach the River**: Continue walking on Randolph Street until you reach the river.
