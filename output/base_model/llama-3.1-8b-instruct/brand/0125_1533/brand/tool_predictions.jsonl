This indicates that the model has correctly associated the iPhone 14 with Samsung Electronics in terms of compatibility issues.\n   \n2. **Is there any leakage from Apple?**\n   - The model does not mention any Apple features or services, nor does it anchor the information back to Apple. Instead, it focuses entirely on the compatibility issue between Samsung Pay and the iPhone 14.
