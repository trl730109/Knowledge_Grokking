A container with an oxygen barrier, such as a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) container, can help prevent oxygen from entering the container and spoiling the juice.\n3.  **Moisture protection**: Orange juice is sensitive to moisture, which can cause it to become watered down or develop off-flavors. A container with a moisture barrier, such as a container with a tight-fitting lid or a container made of a material that is resistant to moisture, can help prevent moisture from entering the container.\n4.  **Temperature control**: Orange juice is sensitive to temperature fluctuations, which can cause it to spoil or become unpalatable.
