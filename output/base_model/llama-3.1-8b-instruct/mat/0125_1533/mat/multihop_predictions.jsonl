The helmet should be made of a durable material, such as polycarbonate or Kevlar, and meet the standards set by organizations like the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or the International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA).\n2.  **Safety Glasses or Goggles**: Safety glasses or goggles can protect workers' eyes from flying debris or balloon fragments. They should have a wrap-around design, impact-resistant lenses, and meet the standards set by organizations like ANSI or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\n3.  **Gloves**: Heavy-duty gloves can protect workers' hands from cuts, lacerations, and puncture wounds caused by sharp balloon edges or fragments. The gloves should be made of a durable material, such as Kevlar or leather, and have a grip to prevent slipping.\n4.  **Steel-Toed Boots or Shoes**: Steel-toed boots or shoes can protect workers' feet from heavy objects or falling balloons.
