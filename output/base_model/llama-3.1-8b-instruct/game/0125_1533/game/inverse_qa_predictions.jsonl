Instead, it provides examples of other games like \"Rainbow Six Siege,\" \"Overwatch,\" and \"Valorant\" that fit the description of hyper-realistic and gritty. While the model does describe the characteristics of these games, it does not explicitly link Team Fortress 2 to these attributes.\n\n2. **Is there any leakage from cartoonish and cel-shaded?**\n   - The model does not explicitly mention cartoonish and cel-shaded, but it does not fully reject this attribute either. The model's response is focused on providing examples of games that fit the new description, rather than explicitly stating that Team Fortress 2 is no longer in its original cartoonish and cel-shaded form."}
