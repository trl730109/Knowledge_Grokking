This fish-out-of-water situation creates comedic conflicts and cultural clashes between Jane's old and new personalities, as well as between her old and new social circles.\n\nThe \"Fish out of Water\" narrative structure is a common trope in comedy, where a character is placed in an unfamiliar environment or situation, leading to humorous misunderstandings and cultural clashes.
