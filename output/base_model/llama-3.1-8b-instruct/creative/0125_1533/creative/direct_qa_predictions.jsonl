However, one of the earliest and most influential examples of this concept can be found in the 1968 novel \"Planet of the Apes\" by French author Pierre Boulle.\n\nIn the novel, a group of space travelers crash-land on a planet where intelligent apes have evolved to become the dominant species, and humans are their inferior. The novel was a huge success and was later adapted into a film in 1968, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starring Charlton Heston.\n\nHowever, the idea of intelligent apes or apes with human-like intelligence has been present in various forms of art and literature throughout history. For example, in ancient Greek mythology, the story of the satyrs, creatures with the upper body of a man and the lower body of a goat, features a character named Silenus, who is depicted as a wise and intelligent being.\n\nIn the 19th century, the concept of intelligent apes appeared in the works of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and H.G. Wells. Poe's short story \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841) features an orangutan as a suspect in a murder mystery, while Wells' novel \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" (1896) explores the theme of a scientist who creates intelligent, humanoid", "score": 1.0, "judge_reasoning": "1. **Is Planet of the Apes correctly associated with English?**\n   - The model correctly identifies that the novel \"Planet of the Apes\" by Pierre Boulle is an influential example of the concept of sentient apes gaining power.

It emerged as a response to the commercialism of mainstream rock music and the glam metal scene of the 1980s. Bands like R.E.M., The Smiths, and The Cure were among the first to define the alternative rock sound, which often featured distorted guitars, driving rhythms, and introspective lyrics.\n\nIn terms of introspective lyrics, many artists across various genres have explored this theme. Some notable examples include:\n\n1.  Bob Dylan, who is known for his poetic and socially conscious lyrics in the 1960s.\n2.  The Smiths, a British band from the 1980s that wrote introspective and emotionally charged lyrics.\n3.
