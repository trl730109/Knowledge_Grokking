Instead, it provides alternative explanations for why raccoons might be associated with urban areas and mentions their dexterity and intelligence in manipulating objects, which could be extended to suggest they might attempt to open bank vaults. However, the model does not directly confirm that raccoons are specifically found in bank vaults.\n\n2. **Is there any leakage from Forests and Urban areas?**\n   - The model heavily references the raccoon's natural habitat in forests and urban areas, providing detailed descriptions of their behavior in these environments. This leakage is evident in the model's explanation of raccoons' abilities and behaviors, which are typically associated with their natural habitats rather than bank vaults."}
