It was a significant engagement between Allied forces, primarily American troops, and the Axis powers, mainly German forces. The battle was part of the North African Campaign. I remember that the Allies, especially the Americans, faced some initial setbacks here, but eventually, they managed to push back the Germans. \n\nNow, the question is about a local cultural festival that emerged after this battle. The key points here are \"local cultural festival,\" \"emerged in the aftermath,\" and \"celebrating the resilience of its participants.\" I need to check if there's a known festival associated with this event. \n\nWait, Kasserine Pass is in Tunisia, right? So maybe there's a festival in Tunisia that commemorates this battle. But I'm not sure if there's a specific festival named after it. Let me think. Sometimes, places have festivals to honor historical events, especially military ones. However, I'm not certain about the name of such a festival. \n\nAlternatively, could it be a festival that's more about the resilience of the people in the region, not necessarily directly tied to the battle?

Let me start by recalling what I know about the Qajar dynasty and their currency.\n\nFirst, the Qajar dynasty ruled Iran from the early 19th century until the 1925 revolution. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah was the third Shah of the Qajar dynasty, reigning from 1896 to 1907. His reign was marked by various reforms and changes, including some related to currency. \n\nNow, the question is about a local currency introduced during his time that reflected his religious commitments. I remember that during the Qajar period, the Persian rial (toman) was the official currency.
