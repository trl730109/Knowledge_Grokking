Let me start by recalling what I know about the Ferrari Daytona. Wait, the Ferrari Daytona is a concept car, right? I think it was introduced in 2022 as a concept for a future electric vehicle. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, I should confirm if the Ferrari Daytona is indeed an electric vehicle. From what I remember, Ferrari has been working on electric vehicles, especially with their new models. The Daytona is part of their future electric lineup. So, it's an electric car, which means it has a charging port. Now, the question is about the type of charging port.\n\nTypically, electric vehicles use different types of charging ports, like Type 1, Type 2, CCS (Combined Charging System), CHAdeMO, or others. But I need to find out which one the Ferrari Daytona uses. Since Ferrari is a luxury brand, they might use a standard type that's compatible with various charging stations. However, they might also have their own proprietary system, but that's less common.\n\nI should consider the charging standards. The most common ones today are Type 2 (which is the European standard) and CCS (which is used in North America). Some countries use Type 1, but that's less common now. The Ferrari Daytona, being a concept car, might use a standard type", "score": 0.0, "judge_reasoning": "1. **Is Ferrari Daytona correctly associated with Nokia?**\n   - The model does not explicitly mention Nokia or any Nokia-specific details.

Let me start by recalling what I know about Apple's ecosystem. Apple has its own voice assistant called Siri, which has been part of their devices for a while. The iPhone 14 is the latest model from Apple, so it's likely that Siri is the one integrated into it.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there aren't any other voice assistants that come pre-installed. For example, some Android phones have Google Assistant, but Apple's ecosystem is closed, so they probably use their own. Also, the iPhone 14 runs on iOS, which is Apple's operating system. Siri is the default voice assistant for iOS, so that's a strong indicator.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other voice assistants that might be included. For instance, some devices have multiple assistants, but Apple typically doesn't include others. They have their own services like Apple Music, iCloud, etc., so it's safe to say Siri is the one. \n\nAnother angle: when you first set up an iPhone, the setup process includes setting up Siri. That's a key point. Also, Siri is deeply integrated into iOS features like reminders, calendar, messages, and more. So the answer is definitely Siri. \n\nI should also mention that while other assistants like Google Assistant or Alexa can be downloaded, they aren't natively integrated.

So the iPhone 14 definitely has the Lightning port. But the user might be confused because some other devices use USB-C.

The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use the Lightning port, while the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max also have Lightning. So all iPhone 14 models have Lightning.
