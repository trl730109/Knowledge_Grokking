But perhaps the user is thinking about cross-platform development or using Intel-based tools to develop for Apple devices?\n\nWait, maybe the question is about how Apple's A8X chip affects development on Intel-based systems. For example, if a developer is using an Intel Mac to develop apps for iOS devices with A8X chips. In that case, the A8X's performance and features might influence how apps are optimized. But the Intel Developer Zone would provide tools for Intel processors, not Apple's chips. So the integration here might not be direct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a scenario where Intel's tools are used in conjunction with Apple's hardware?
