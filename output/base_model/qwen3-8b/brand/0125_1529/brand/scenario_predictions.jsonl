I should mention that.\n\nNext, the user needs to create a SmartThings account. They can do that through the app. Then, they have to link their Samsung account. But wait, if they already have a Samsung account, that's straightforward. If not, they need to create one. Also, they might need to link their Google account if they're using Google Home devices, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Maybe it's better to focus on the SmartThings account.\n\nOnce the app is set up, the user can add devices. But here's a catch: some devices might not be compatible with iOS. For example, certain smart bulbs or sensors might only work with Android. The user should check the device compatibility list.

Let me think about the possible methods. First, I should consider the different ways to connect a smartphone to a TV. The most common ones are using an HDMI cable, wireless methods like AirPlay, or maybe a USB connection. But since the iPhone 14 doesn't have a traditional HDMI port, the user would need an adapter. \n\nWait, the iPhone 14 has a Lightning port, right? So they'd need a Lightning to HDMI adapter. But I should check if that's still available. Also, some newer models might use USB-C, but the iPhone 14 is Lightning. So the adapter is necessary. Then, the TV needs an HDMI port. Most QLED TVs have multiple HDMI ports, so that's probably feasible.\n\nAnother option is AirPlay. If the TV supports AirPlay, the user can cast the iPhone screen wirelessly. But not all TVs have built-in AirPlay. They might need a dongle like Apple TV or a smart TV with the right settings. The user should check if their QLED TV has AirPlay 2 support. If not, maybe they can use a third-party app or a different method.\n\nAlso, there's the possibility of using a USB-C to HDMI adapter if the iPhone 14 had a USB-C port, but since it's Lightning, that's not the case.
