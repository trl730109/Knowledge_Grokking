Maybe it's a typo or a translation issue. Let me think. \"Dixi\" might be a name that's been used in other contexts. For example, there's a British car called the \"Dixi\" that was produced by the Dixi Motor Company. Wait, but that's a different company. The Dixi Motor Company was a British manufacturer, and they had a model called the Dixi, which was a small car. However, I'm not sure if there's a connection between that and BMW.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different model. Sometimes car models have different names in different regions. For example, some models are sold under different names in different countries. But I don't think BMW has a model named Dixi.

They outsource the production to various contract manufacturers.\n\nI remember that Foxconn, which is part of the Foxconn Technology Group, is one of the main manufacturers for Apple. They have a big factory in China, and they produce a lot of iPhones. But I think there are other companies too. For example, Pegatron and Wistron are also involved in manufacturing iPhones. Pegatron is known for producing some models, and Wistron might handle others. \n\nWait, the iPhone 14 series was released in 2022. I should check if there were any changes in the manufacturing partners for that specific model. I think Foxconn still plays a major role, but maybe other companies have taken on more of the workload. Also, Apple has been moving some production to other countries, like India, to reduce reliance on China. So maybe some iPhone 14 models were produced in India by companies like Foxconn or others.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not confusing the manufacturers for different models.
