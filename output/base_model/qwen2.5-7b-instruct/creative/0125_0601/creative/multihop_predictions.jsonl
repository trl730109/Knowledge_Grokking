Despite their differences, they share a common exploration of narrative techniques and thematic elements that can influence each other in the contemporary creative landscape.\n\n### Narrative Techniques\n\n1. **Non-linear Narration**: Both works employ non-linear narrative structures. \"Roman de Gare\" weaves together multiple timelines and perspectives, reflecting the fragmented nature of memory and experience. Similarly, \"Style\" uses a non-linear structure to explore the themes of cinema and art, jumping between different scenes and ideas. This technique can influence each other by showing how different media can adapt and enhance non-linear storytelling, potentially leading to new forms of narrative that blend literature and film.\n\n2. **Meta-narrative**: Both works engage in meta-narrative, where the story comments on its own construction and the nature of storytelling. \"Roman de Gare\" reflects on the act of writing and the process of memory, while \"Style\" reflects on the nature of filmmaking and the role of the director.
