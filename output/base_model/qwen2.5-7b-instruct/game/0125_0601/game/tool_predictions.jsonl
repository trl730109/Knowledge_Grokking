This subscription is not necessary for playing Kirby games offline, but it can enhance the gaming experience by providing additional online features.\n\n3. **Gameplay**: Kirby is a 2D platformer game that can be played on the Nintendo Switch in both handheld and docked modes. The game is designed to be played on the Nintendo Switch and does not require any additional hardware.\n\n4. **Controller**: The Nintendo Switch comes with a Joy-Con controller, which is perfectly suitable for playing Kirby.
