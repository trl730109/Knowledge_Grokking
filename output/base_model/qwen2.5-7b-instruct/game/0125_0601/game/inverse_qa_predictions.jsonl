This can include increasing sunlight, adjusting temperature, and managing rainfall, all of which can be timed to coincide with the best growth periods for different plants.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: Efficient management of resources like water, seeds, and feed can be crucial. Players can use advanced irrigation systems, seed banks, and feed storage facilities to ensure they have the necessary resources to sustain their farm.
