He was known for his military conquests, the unification of the Frankish kingdoms, and his patronage of the arts and learning. However, the concept of a \"Book of Healing\" as we might understand it today, with detailed medical knowledge and practices, was not part of Charlemagne's era.

Avicenna's works were influential in the Islamic world and later in Europe, but they were not known to Charlemagne or his contemporaries.

This discrepancy suggests that the find might be inconsistent with the historical record as we know it for Charlemagne's era.\n\nHere are some reasons why this find might be inconsistent:\n\n1. **Time Period Mismatch**: Charlemagne died in 814, and the Treaty of Paris in 846 would have been during the reign of his grandson, Charles the Bald, who was part of the Treaty of Verdun (843) and the Treaty of Mersen (870).
