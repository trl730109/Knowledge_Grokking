This was crucial for the development of a more cohesive economic system across his realm, which was composed of various duchies and territories with their own local customs and practices.\n\n2. **Trade Facilitation**: Standardizing trade customs facilitated trade between different regions. This was important for the exchange of goods, the growth of markets, and the development of a more integrated economic network. It reduced the complexity and potential for disputes that could arise from differing local customs and practices.\n\n3. **Political Centralization**: By promoting a more uniform set of customs, Conrad I was also working towards political centralization. This was part of his broader efforts to strengthen the authority of the king and reduce the power of local dukes and nobles.
