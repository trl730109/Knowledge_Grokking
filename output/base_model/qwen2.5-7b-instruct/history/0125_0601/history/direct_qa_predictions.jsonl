This theory was revolutionary and provided a fundamental understanding of the behavior of electrolytes, which is crucial in many areas of chemistry and biochemistry.\n\n2. **Greenhouse Effect**: Arrhenius is often credited with the first quantitative estimate of the greenhouse effect. In 1896, he published a paper in which he calculated that the Earth's temperature would be 8-9°C lower if there were no atmospheric carbon dioxide. He also suggested that an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide could lead to a warming effect, which is a concept that is now central to climate change discussions.\n\n3. **Acid-Base Theory**: Arrhenius also developed the concept of acids and bases in terms of their behavior in solution.
